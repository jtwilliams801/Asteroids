#Asteroids

Mostly a copy of the Asteroids game done on CodingTrain (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hacZU523FyM)

Things that I changed
-The shape of the ship. Dumb but better
-Added sounds. This is a big improvement.
-Flame on thrust
-Speed up background beat when fewer asteroids



What I still want to do:
-Add the flying saucer
-GAME OVER message
-Ability to restart the game
-Maybe a score
-Multi laser. Maybe a three laser shot with some spread
-Shield
-Drop Mines
